&nbsp&nbsp Air conditioning can be described as the process of cooling, heating, moisturizing, dehumidifying, etc.
This method is utilized to create a more pleasant interior environment. In this project, you are required
to design an air conditioner system for small spaces. The system acquires heating, and cooling functions
and consists of one variable set input and four subsystems, namely, the control unit, display unit, sensing
unit, and the operation unit. The sensing unit provides the ambient temperature to the control unit, and
the temperature adjustment unit provides the desired temperature to the control unit. Figure 1 shows
the block diagram of the system.

&nbsp&nbsp Thus to design a responsive, fast, and accurate temperature control system PID method is a feasible choice. One challenge, of applying PID method to this problem is that the heating and cooling processes are not symmetric. To compensate that, a modified PID control circuit will be introduced in this paper. Also, to avoid the EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and noise problems, the circuit is designed on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The heating element is a nickel-chromium wire and the cooling element is an 12V DC fan. The fan and the heater are driven with a MOSFET switch which is controlled by the generated PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals. The PWM for each switch is generated by comparing a triangular wave with the PID outputs.

&nbsp&nbsp The ambient temperature is measured using the LM35 analog temperature sensor. The set temperature value is adjusted with a potentiometer. The set and ambient temperatures are displayed by the display unit which consist of RGB LEDs (Red Green Blue Light Emitting Diodes), a constant current LED drive utilized by a transconductance amplifier. The display unit designed in a way to emit red light at 24°Cand below, green light at 32°Cand blue light at 40°C and above. The display output for the temperature intervals between those values are produced by combining the colors in a way that a smooth transition is observed while the set and ambient temperatures are changed.

&nbsp&nbsp In this project, first the design methodology and the mathematical analysis of each unit will be discussed in detail in section II. The circuit schematics and their analysis will be given in this part. The mechanical design and the manufacturing will be discussed in section III. Then, thermal modelling of the system will be explained in section IV. The results of the performed LTspice simulations will be given in section V. The experimental results and the comparison with the simulation will follow in section VI. Finally, the conclusions will be drawn in section VII.

&nbsp&nbsp In this <a href="https://github.com/ozgurgulsuna/EE313-ModifiedPIDTemperatureController/blob/main/Design%20of%20an%20Autonomous%20Temperature%20Conditioning%20System%20Using%20Modified%20PID%20Controller.pdf">report </a>, the design and implementation of an autonomous temperature conditioning system is demonstrated. Electrical and thermal systems are modelled in a single simulation environment with feedback loop closed. The PID method is shown that its applicable to this system, but due to the asymmetry of the reverse processes a modified PID circuit is proposed to damp oscillations of the system around the steady state, which is shown to be successful with the experimental results. Moreover, since the control signals are critical for the process, it is observed that filtering the noise with low and high pass filters and also avoiding the EMI effects with a careful PCB design procedure is essential for an accurate and reliable control mechanism.
